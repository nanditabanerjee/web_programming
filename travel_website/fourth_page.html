<h2>CHECHURIA</h2>
<p>Only 19 km from Bishnupur, Chechuria is a manmade eco-sanctuary that can be an ideal retreat for those who would love to go for a picnic party with their family. 
Inside the park there are walking trails lined with varieties of trees. The chirping of birds, fresh air and quiet environment remove all exhaustions of day to day life.</p>
<p>At the Chechuria Eco Park one can arrange a get together. One can get friends whom they rarely meet or even siblings and cousins and enjoy in each other’s company. 
Then, people who are interested can go to Latapara, which is a tribal village located nearby.
 Panchmura, which is a village where terracotta artisans stay, can also be visited from Chechuria. It is at a distance of 12 km.</p>

Opening time: 8 am – 4-45 pm.

<h1>How to get to Chechuria Eco Park?</h1>
<p>The easiest way to go to Chechuria Eco Park is to go to Bishnupur, which lies at a distance of 19 km. However, if one does not have a car then there are other options such as 
autos and trekkers that can be taken on hire. In addition, one may take trains to the Eco Park that are available from both Bishnupur and Bankura.
